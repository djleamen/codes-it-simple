# Files and Directories

Welcome to **Files and Directories**! In this lesson, we’ll explore the basics of navigating the Linux filesystem using the terminal. You’ll learn how to find your location, list the contents of directories, and understand how the filesystem is organized.

### Learning Objectives
- Create and delete files and directories.
- Copy and move files and directories.
- Manage file permissions to make them executable.

## Creating and Deleting Files and Directories

1. **`mkdir` Command**:
    - Creates a new directory.
    - Example:
        
        ```bash
        mkdir test
        ```
        
2. **`rm` Command**:
    - Removes files or directories.
    - Options:
        - Remove a file:
            
            ```bash
            rm file1
            ```
            
        - Remove a directory and its contents:
            
            ```bash
            rm -r folder1
            ```
            
        - **Caution**: Be careful when using `rm -r` as it can delete important data.
3. **`rmdir` Command**:
    - Removes empty directories only.
    - Example:
        
        ```bash
        rmdir test
        ```
        
4. **`touch` Command**:
    - Creates empty files or updates the last-modified date of existing files.
    - Examples:
        - Create files:
            
            ```bash
            touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
            ```
            
        - Update the last-modified date:
            
            ```bash
            touch notes.txt
            ```

## Copying and Moving Files and Directories

1. **`cp` Command**:
    - Copies files or directories.
    - Options:
        - Copy a file to another directory:
            
            ```bash
            cp notes.txt Documents/
            ```
            
        - Copy a directory and its contents:
            
            ```bash
            cp -r Documents Docs_cop
            ```
            
2. **`mv` Command**:
    - Moves or renames files and directories.
    - Examples:
        - Move a file:
            
            ```bash
            mv my_script.sh Scripts/
            ```
            
        - Move directories:
            
            ```bash
            mv Notes Scripts Documents/
            ```

## Managing File Permissions

1. **`chmod` Command**:
    - Changes file permissions (read, write, execute).
    - Example:
        - Add executable permissions to a script:
            
            ```bash
            chmod +x my_script.sh
            ```
            
        - Verify permissions:
            
            ```bash
            ls -l my_script.sh
            ```

## Summary

- **`touch`**: Creates a new file or updates the last-modified date of an existing file.
- **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory.
- **`rmdir`**: Removes empty directories.
- **`rm`**: Deletes files or directories (`r` for recursive deletion).
- **`cp`**: Copies files or directories (`r` for recursive copying).
- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files and directories.
- **`chmod`**: Changes file permissions to add read, write, or execute access.
These commands are essential for managing files and directories in a Linux environment.
