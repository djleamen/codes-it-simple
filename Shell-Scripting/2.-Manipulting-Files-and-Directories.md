# Files and Directories

Welcome to **Files and Directories**! In this lesson, we’ll explore the basics of navigating the Linux filesystem using the terminal. You’ll learn how to find your location, list the contents of directories, and understand how the filesystem is organized.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Navigate the Linux filesystem using the terminal.
- Use basic commands like `pwd` and `ls`.

### The Linux Filesystem
Linux uses a hierarchical filesystem starting from the **root (`/`)**. Key directories include:
- **`/home`**: User directories.
- **`/bin`**: Essential binaries.

### Navigating the Filesystem
1. **`pwd`**:
   - Displays the current directory.
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   /home/user
   ```

2. **`ls`**:
   - Lists directory contents.
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Documents  Downloads  Pictures
   ```

3. **Combine Commands**:
   ```bash
   pwd && ls
   ```
