# Files and Directories

Welcome to **Files and Directories**! In this lesson, we’ll explore the basics of navigating the Linux filesystem using the terminal. You’ll learn how to find your location, list the contents of directories, and understand how the filesystem is organized.

## Key Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Describe what a Linux terminal is used for.
- Use the `pwd` and `ls` commands to browse directories in your Linux file system.

## The Linux Terminal

The **Linux terminal** (also called the command line or command prompt) is a powerful interface that lets you interact with the Linux shell by entering commands. It allows you to:

- Navigate the filesystem.
- Manage files and directories.
- Run programs and scripts.

### Terminal Basics
- The terminal displays your **present working directory (PWD)** followed by a **command prompt**, represented by the dollar sign `$`.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    /home/project $
    ```
  - Here, `/home/project` is the present working directory.

### How to Use the Terminal
1. **Entering Commands**:
   - Type a command and press **Enter**.
   - Many commands produce output, displayed as text in the terminal.
   - The command prompt reappears after each execution, ready for the next input.

## Common Linux Commands

### **`pwd` Command**

- **`pwd`** stands for "print working directory."
- It displays the absolute path of your current location in the filesystem.

#### Usage
- Example:
  ```bash
  /home/project $ pwd
  /home/project
  ```
  - The output shows that the current working directory is `/home/project`.

---

### **`ls` Command**

- **`ls`** lists the contents of the current working directory.
- If the directory is empty, `ls` returns nothing and does not display a blank line.

#### Usage
1. **Basic Listing**:
   ```bash
   /home/project $ ls
   ```
   - Displays the names of files and directories in the current location.

2. **List Contents of a Specific Directory**:
   - Specify the path to a directory after the `ls` command.
     ```bash
     /home/project $ ls /home
     project  theia
     ```
   - Output shows that `/home` contains two subdirectories: `project` and `theia`.

3. **Additional Options**:
   - `ls` can be used with various flags (covered in future lessons) to display detailed information, sort files, or filter results.

## Understanding Directories

### **What are Directories?**
Directories in Linux are like folders on other operating systems. They contain:

- Files.
- Subdirectories (folders within folders).

#### Example
- `/home/project` means that `project` is a subdirectory of `/home`.
- `/home/theia` is another subdirectory of `/home`.

### **Linux Filesystem Structure**
- The Linux filesystem is hierarchical and starts from the **root directory**, denoted as `/`.
- All files and directories branch out from the root.

#### Key Directories:
1. **`/`**: Root directory (top of the filesystem tree).
2. **`/home`**: Contains user directories.
   - Example:
     - `/home/user1` for user1.
     - `/home/user2` for user2.

---

## Tips for Navigating the Filesystem

1. **Think of Paths Like Addresses**:
   - Each directory or file has a unique path.
   - Paths can be absolute (from `/`) or relative (from the current directory).

2. **Use Commands Together**:
   - Combine `pwd` and `ls` to always know where you are and what’s available.

---

## Summary

- The **Linux terminal** is your gateway to navigating and managing files in Linux.
- Use the **`pwd` command** to display your current location in the filesystem.
- Use the **`ls` command** to list the contents of a directory.
- Directories are hierarchical, starting from the root `/`.
