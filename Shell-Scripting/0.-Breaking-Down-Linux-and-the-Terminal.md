### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand the role of an operating system (OS) and Linux's significance.
- Learn about the layers of a Linux system and their functionalities.
- Gain familiarity with the terminal and its connection to the Linux shell.

### What is an Operating System (OS)?
An operating system is the backbone of any computing device. It:
- Manages hardware resources.
- Provides a user interface.
- Enables communication between applications.

### A Brief History of Linux
1. **Unix (1960s)**: Developed at AT&T Bell Labs, rewritten in C for portability.
2. **Linux (1991)**: Linus Torvalds introduced a free, open-source kernel, combining it with GNU tools to form a complete OS.
   - Powers servers, smartphones, and supercomputers today.

### Why Linux?
Linux is favored for its:
- **Open Source Nature**: Cost-free and community-driven.
- **Security**: Designed for multi-user environments.
- **Portability**: Runs on devices from IoT gadgets to supercomputers.

#### Applications of Linux
- **Android**: Linux-based mobile OS.
- **Web Servers**: Powers millions of websites.
- **Supercomputers**: Drives the fastest machines worldwide.

### The Layers of a Linux System
1. **User Interface**: Graphical or terminal-based interaction.
2. **Application Layer**: Tools and programs.
3. **Operating System**: Manages resources and processes.
4. **Kernel**: The core linking hardware and software.
5. **Hardware**: Physical components.

### Introduction to the Linux Terminal
The terminal is a powerful interface for interacting with Linux.
- It allows navigation, command execution, and process management.
- Commands are processed by the shell and executed by the OS.

#### Try It Out
Run these commands in a Linux terminal or an emulator like [Webminal](https://www.webminal.org):
```bash
pwd      # Print working directory
ls       # List files in the directory
whoami   # Display your username
```
