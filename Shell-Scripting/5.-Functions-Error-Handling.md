## Functions and Error Handling
Welcome to Functions and Error Handling in Shell Scripting! In this section, weâ€™ll explore how to create reusable **functions** to streamline your scripts and implement robust **error-handling techniques** to ensure reliability in your shell programs.

### Learning Objectives
After completing this section, you will:
- Define and use functions to modularize your scripts.
- Implement error handling to manage script failures gracefully.

---

### Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They make scripts modular, readable, and easier to debug.

#### Define a Function
```bash
function_name() {
    commands
}
```

#### Example: Greeting Function
```bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "World"  # Output: Hello, World!
```
- `$1` represents the first argument passed to the function.

#### Key Tips
- Use descriptive function names.
- Place function definitions at the beginning of the script for better organization.

---

### Error Handling
Error handling ensures your script can manage unexpected situations.

#### Exit Codes
Every command in Bash returns an exit code:
- `0`: Success.
- Non-zero: Failure.

#### Example: Check Command Success
```bash
mkdir test_dir
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Directory created successfully."
else
    echo "Failed to create directory."
fi
```

#### Using `set` Options
- `set -e`: Exit immediately if a command fails.
- `set -u`: Treat unset variables as errors.
- `set -o pipefail`: Catch errors in pipeline commands.

#### Example: Enable Strict Error Handling
```bash
set -euo pipefail
mkdir new_dir
cd new_dir
```

---

### Summary
- Functions modularize scripts and improve reusability.
- Error handling with exit codes and `set` options ensures robust scripts.
- Practice defining functions and managing errors to build reliable Bash scripts.
