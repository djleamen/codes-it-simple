# Control Structures

Welcome to control Structures! Control structures are the backbone of Bash scripting, allowing you to automate tasks, make decisions, and repeat operations. This section will guide you through **conditional statements**, **logical operators**, **arithmetic operations**, **arrays**, and **`for` loops**.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Use conditional statements to execute commands based on specific conditions.
- Apply logical operators for `true`/`false` comparisons.
- Perform basic arithmetic calculations.
- Create and manipulate arrays.
- Implement `for` loops to repeat operations efficiently.

---

## Conditionals
Conditionals enable scripts to perform actions based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`. Use the `if`-`then`-`else` syntax:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    statement_block_1
else
    statement_block_2
fi
```

### Example: Check the Number of Arguments
```bash
if [[ $# == 2 ]]; then
    echo "Number of arguments is equal to 2"
else
    echo "Number of arguments is not equal to 2"
fi
```

#### Key Tips
- Always use spaces around the condition inside `[ ]`.
- Close every `if` block with `fi`.
- The `else` block is optional but recommended.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators help you create more complex conditions:

| Operator | Description              | Example                |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `[ $a == $b ]`         |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `[ $a != $b ]`         |
| `-le`    | Less than or equal to    | `[ $a -le $b ]`        |
| `&&`     | Logical AND              | `[ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]` |
| `||`     | Logical OR               | `[ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]` |

---

## Arithmetic Calculations
Perform arithmetic using `$(( ))` syntax:

### Example: Addition and Division
```bash
a=3
b=2
sum=$((a + b))
echo $sum  # Output: 5
echo $((3 / 2))  # Output: 1 (truncated)
```

### Supported Operators
| Symbol | Operation       |
|--------|-----------------|
| `+`    | Addition        |
| `-`    | Subtraction     |
| `*`    | Multiplication  |
| `/`    | Division        |

---

## Arrays
Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.

### Create and Access Arrays
```bash
my_array=(1 2 "three" "four" 5)

echo ${my_array[0]}  # First element
echo ${my_array[@]}  # All elements
```

### Add Elements
```bash
my_array+=("six")
my_array+=(7)
```

---

## `for` Loops
`For` loops iterate over a set of items or a range of numbers.

### Example: Loop Through Array
```bash
for item in ${my_array[@]}; do
    echo $item
done
```

### Example: Range Loop
```bash
for (( i=0; i<=5; i++ )); do
    echo $i
done
```

### Example: Array Summation
```bash
my_array=(1 2 3)
count=0
sum=0

for i in ${!my_array[@]}; do
    count=$((count + 1))
    sum=$((sum + my_array[i]))
done

echo "Count: $count"
echo "Sum: $sum"
```
