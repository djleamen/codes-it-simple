### What is Shell Scripting?
A **shell script** is a text file containing commands executed by the shell. Think of it as a to-do list for your computer.

#### Why Learn Shell Scripting?
- **Automation**: Streamlines repetitive tasks.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and reduces errors.
- **Flexibility**: Works across Unix-based systems.
- **Customization**: Adapts to specific needs.

### Writing Your First Script
Follow these steps to create and run a script:
1. **Open a Text Editor**:
   - Example: `nano`, `vim`, or a graphical editor.
2. **Write the Script**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```
3. **Save the File**:
   - Use a `.sh` extension, e.g., `hello_world.sh`.
4. **Make It Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello_world.sh
   ```
5. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./hello_world.sh
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

### Best Practices
- **Use Comments**: Explain your script.
- **Meaningful File Names**: Reflect the script's purpose.
- **Test Safely**: Use test environments before deploying.
- **Keep It Simple**: Start small and expand as needed.
