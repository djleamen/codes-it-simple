# Variables and User Input

Welcome to the next step in your shell scripting journey! In this lesson, we’ll cover how to use **variables** to store and manipulate data and how to accept **user input** to make your scripts interactive. 

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Use variables to store and manipulate data.
- Accept and process user input.

---

### Working with Variables
1. **Declaration**:
   ```bash
   name="DJ"
   ```
2. **Accessing Values**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, $name!"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello, DJ!
   ```
3. **Rules**:
   - Start with a letter or `_`.
   - Avoid special characters.

### User Input
1. **Reading Input**:
   ```bash
   read name
   echo "Hello, $name!"
   ```
2. **Prompting Input**:
   ```bash
   read -p "Enter your favorite language: " language
   echo "You love $language!"
   ```
3. **Hiding Sensitive Input**:
   ```bash
   read -s -p "Enter password: " password
   ```

### Combining Variables and Input
Example script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "What is your name? " name
read -p "What is your favorite language? " language
echo "Hello, $name! It’s great that you love $language."
```
