# Variables and User Input

Welcome to the next step in your shell scripting journey! In this lesson, we’ll cover how to use **variables** to store and manipulate data and how to accept **user input** to make your scripts interactive. Let’s dive in!

## Variables in Shell Scripting

### **What is a Variable?**
A **variable** is a named placeholder for storing data. Think of it as a box where you can put information you’ll use later in your script.

### **Declaring Variables**
- In shell scripting, variables are declared without a data type.
- Syntax:
  ```bash
  variable_name=value
  ```
  - No spaces around the `=` sign.

### **Using Variables**
- To access a variable’s value, prefix its name with `$`.
- Example:
  ```bash
  name="DJ"
  echo "Hello, $name!"
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Hello, DJ!
  ```

### **Rules for Variable Names**
1. Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).
2. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
3. Avoid using special characters or starting with numbers.
4. Variable names are **case-sensitive** (`NAME` is different from `name`).

## Types of Variables

### **Local Variables**
- Only available within the script or shell session where they are defined.

### **Environment Variables**
- Available to all child processes of the shell.
- Example: `PATH`, `HOME`.
- To create an environment variable, use the `export` command:
  ```bash
  export MY_VAR="This is global"
  ```

### **Special Variables**
- These are predefined variables with special meanings.
- Examples:
  - `$0`: The name of the script.
  - `$1, $2, ...`: Arguments passed to the script.
  - `$#`: Number of arguments passed to the script.
  - `$@`: All arguments passed to the script.
  - `$$`: The process ID of the script.

## User Input in Shell Scripts

### **Reading User Input**
The `read` command allows you to accept input from the user during script execution.

#### **Syntax**
```bash
read variable_name
```

#### **Example**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for the user’s name
echo "What is your name?"
read name

echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to shell scripting."
```
Output:
```
What is your name?
DJ
Hello, DJ! Welcome to shell scripting.
```

### **Providing a Prompt with `read`**
You can use the `-p` flag to display a prompt on the same line as the input request.
```bash
read -p "Enter your favorite programming language: " language
echo "You love $language!"
```

### **Hiding Input (e.g., Passwords)**
Use the `-s` flag to hide user input (useful for passwords).
```bash
read -s -p "Enter your password: " password
```

## Combining Variables and User Input
Here’s an example script that combines variables and user input to create a personalized greeting:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for the user’s name and favorite programming language
read -p "What is your name? " name
read -p "What is your favorite programming language? " language

# Display the personalized message
echo "Hello, $name! It’s great that you love $language."
```
Output:
```
What is your name? DJ
What is your favorite programming language? Java
Hello, DJ! It’s great that you love Java.
```

## Best Practices for Variables and User Input

1. **Use Descriptive Variable Names**:
   - Make your scripts more readable.
   - Example: Use `user_name` instead of `x`.

2. **Validate User Input**:
   - Ensure users enter valid data to avoid script errors.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     read -p "Enter a number: " num
     if ! [[ "$num" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
       echo "Error: Input is not a number."
       exit 1
     fi
     ```

3. **Use Default Values**:
   - Provide default values to variables if no input is given.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     read -p "Enter your name (default: Guest): " name
     name=${name:-Guest}
     echo "Hello, $name!"
     ```

4. **Secure Sensitive Input**:
   - Hide sensitive data like passwords using the `-s` flag.

## Key Takeaways

- Variables store and manipulate data, making your scripts dynamic.
- The `read` command accepts user input and assigns it to variables.
- Use descriptive names and validate input for better script quality.
- Practice combining variables and user input to create interactive scripts.
