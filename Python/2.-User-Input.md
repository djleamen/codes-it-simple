# User Input and Type Conversion

In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore input, how to use it, and variable type conversion.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand how to use input
- Understand how to work with user input
- Learn how to convert variable types

## Input

Input is a way to get information from the user. It allows the user to enter data that can be used in the program.
Example:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

### Raw input
In Python 2, the `input()` function is used to get input from the user. In Python 3, the `input()` function is 
used to get input from the user as a string. In Python 3, the `raw_input()` function is used to get any input from the user.

Example:
```python
name = raw_input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

For simplicity, we will use the `input()` function in this course.

## Working with user input

When working with user input, it is important to remember that the input function always returns a string. 
If you want to use the input as a number, you will need to convert it to an integer or a float.

## Type Conversion

Type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another. In Python, you can convert one data type to another using the following functions:
- `int()`: converts a value to an integer
- `float()`: converts a value to a floating-point number
- `str()`: converts a value to a string
- `bool()`: converts a value to a boolean

This is especially helpful when working with user input, since the input function always returns a string.

Example:
```python
num = input("Enter a number: ")
num = int(num)
print(num + 5)
```

## Common Errors

### ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'
This error occurs when you try to convert a string that cannot be converted to an integer.

Example:
```python
num = input("Enter a number: ")
num = int(num)
print(num + 5)
```

If you enter a string that cannot be converted to an integer, you will see the following error:
```python
Enter a number: hello
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "input.py", line 2, in <module>
    num = int(num)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'
```

### TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
This error occurs when you try to concatenate a string with a number.

Example:
```python
num = input("Enter a number: ")
print("Hello" + num)
``` 

If you enter a number, you will see the following error:
```python
Enter a number: 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "input.py", line 2, in <module>
    print("Hello" + num)
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

Make sure you're always converting the input to the correct type before using it in your program.
