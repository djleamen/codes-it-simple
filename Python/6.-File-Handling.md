# File Handling in Python

In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore how to work with files in Python, including reading, writing, and appending data.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand how to open and close files
- Learn how to read data from files
- Learn how to write and append data to files

## Opening and Closing Files

In Python, you can use the `open()` function to work with files. It is important to close the file after you are done working with it to free up system resources.

Example:
```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Open the file in read mode
print(file.read())  # Read the file content
file.close()  # Close the file
```

### Using the `with` Statement
The `with` statement is a better way to work with files because it automatically closes the file for you.

Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())  # Read the file content
```

## Reading Files

You can read files in different ways:
- `read()`: Reads the entire file content as a string.
- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.
- `readlines()`: Reads all lines and returns them as a list.

Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.readline())  # Read the first line
    print(file.readlines())  # Read the remaining lines as a list
```

---

## Writing to Files

To write to a file, open it in write mode (`"w"`) or append mode (`"a"`). Write mode overwrites the file, while append mode adds to the file.

Example:
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a new line.\n")

# Appending to a file
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("This is an appended line.\n")
```

---

## Common Errors

### FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
This error occurs when you try to open a file that does not exist.

Example:
```python
with open("nonexistent.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

Solution: Ensure the file exists or handle the error using a `try-except` block.

### UnsupportedOperation: not writable
This error occurs when you try to write to a file opened in read mode.

Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    file.write("This will fail.")
```

Solution: Open the file in write (`"w"`) or append (`"a"`) mode.
