# 1.    Ask the user for their name

# 2.    Ask the user for their age

# 3.    Ask the user for their height

# 4.    Print out the user's name, age, and height, ensuring that the output is formatted as follows:
#       Name: [name]
#       Age: [age]
#       Height: [height]
#       (where [name], [age], and [height] are the values the user entered)

# 5.    Calculate how old the user will be in 50 years and print out the result in the following format:
#       In 50 years, [name] will be [future_age] years old.
#       (where [name] is the user's name and [future_age] is the calculated age)    
#       (Hint: You will need to convert the user's age to an integer before performing the calculation)
