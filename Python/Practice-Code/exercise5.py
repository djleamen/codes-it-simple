# 1. Write a Python program to create a list of numbers, add a new number to it, and then find the maximum value in the list.
# Example:
# my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# Add 4 to the list and find the maximum value.

# 2. Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs. Write code to add a new key-value pair and print all the values in the dictionary.
# Example:
# my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
# Add a new key-value pair for "country" and print all values.

# 3. Write a Python program to create a tuple with three elements. Access the second element in the tuple.
# Example:
# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# Access the second element (2).
