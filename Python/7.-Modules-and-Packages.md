# Modules and Packages in Python

In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore how to organize and reuse code in Python using modules and packages.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand what modules and packages are
- Learn how to import and use modules
- Learn how to create your own modules and packages

## What Are Modules?

A module is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, or variables) that can be reused in other Python programs. Modules help organize code into manageable pieces.

Example:
```python
# math_module.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
```

You can import and use this module in another file:
```python
import math_module

print(math_module.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
print(math_module.subtract(5, 3))  # Output: 2
```

---

## Built-in Modules

Python comes with many built-in modules that provide additional functionality. For example:
- `math`: Provides mathematical functions
- `os`: Provides functions to interact with the operating system
- `random`: Provides functions to generate random numbers

Example:
```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
```

---

## Creating Your Own Modules

You can create your own module by saving Python code in a `.py` file. For example:
```python
# my_module.py
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

To use it:
```python
import my_module

print(my_module.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## What Are Packages?

A package is a collection of modules organized in directories. A package must contain an `__init__.py` file (can be empty) to be recognized as a package.

Example structure:
```
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```

You can import modules from a package:
```python
from my_package import module1

# Use functions from module1
```

---

## Importing Specific Functions or Classes

You can import specific functions or classes from a module:
```python
from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0
```

---

## Common Errors

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_name'
This error occurs when Python cannot find the module you are trying to import.

Solution: Ensure the module is in the same directory or in the Python path.

### ImportError: cannot import name 'name'
This error occurs when the specified function or class does not exist in the module.

Solution: Double-check the module and the name you are importing.
