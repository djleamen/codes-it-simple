# Welcome to Python! üêç

In this course, we‚Äôll dive into the basics of Python and what makes it so popular for everyone, ranging from brand new coders to professional developers. Let's start with the essentials here!

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Learn the very basics of Python
    - Have practice using variables
    - Understand types
    - Learn what comments are

## Variables

Variables are the boxes you place your piece of data or info into. If you've seen them in math, you already know exactly how they work.
For example, say we want to store our number 5 in a variable called x.
```x = 5```
Variables **must**:
- Start with a name (should be relevant)
- Equal sign to value
- Variables can be strings, booleans, integers or floats.

Now hang on, what are all those things?

### Data Types in Variables

Variables can store different types of data depending on what you want to save. Here are the main types you‚Äôll encounter in Python:
- String: Text data, like names or words. Strings are enclosed in quotes (``' '`` or ``" "``).
    - Example: `name = "DJ"`
- Integer: Whole numbers, like 1, 25, or -100.
    - Example: `age = 20`
- Float: Numbers with decimal points, like 3.14 or 0.99.
    -Example: `pi = 3.14159`
- Boolean: Values that are either True or False.
    - Example: `is_learning = True`

Let‚Äôs try declaring multiple variables in one line:
```python
    name, age, is_student = "DJ", 19, True
```

Note: You can use the `type()` function to check what the type of a variable is!
Example:
```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

## Using Variables

Once you‚Äôve assigned a variable, you can access its value or use it in calculations.
```python
    x = 5
    y = 10
    result = x + y
    print(result)  # Output: 15
```
*Note: We'll talk about how to use it a little more next lecture, but the `print()` function lets you see your output on the console! In your exercise, it's already given to you.*

## Updating Variable Values

Variables can change their values. You don‚Äôt need to re-declare the type.
```python 
x = 5
x = x + 2
print(x)  # Output: 7  
```

## Strings and Concatenation

You can combine strings using the + operator or a comma in the print() function:
```python
first_name = "DJ"
last_name = "Leamen"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Hello, my name is", full_name)
```

## Common Errors with Variables
1. **Name Errors**: Using a variable before it‚Äôs defined.
```python
print(x)  # Error: Name 'x' is not defined
```
2. **Case Sensitive**: Python variables are case-sensitive.
```python
name = "DJ"
Name = "Bob"
print(name)  # Outputs: DJ
print(Name)  # Outputs: Bob
```

## Comments

Comments are used in Python to document code or help explain what something does. They aren't used by the program and are written for anyone looking at and directly working with your code.

You can write comments in two ways:
- **Single-line**: Use a hash (`#`) symbol. Anything after the symbol on the line is ignored.
- **Multi-line**: Use three quote symbols (`"""`) before and after the lines you write your code on.

Example:
```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
explaining the code on more
than one line.
"""
```

## Basic File Structure

It's good practice to organize your Python files neatly. The best way to run code directly is by putting it inside of a `main` function:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```

For our purposes and for simplicty, we won't use classes in our examples. However, as you advance to larger projects, it's a good idea to keep this in mind.
