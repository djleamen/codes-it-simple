# Functions

In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore functions in Python.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand how to define and use functions
- Learn about built-in functions in Python
- Differentiate between local and global functions
- Understand the importance of declaring functions before calling them

## Defining Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the `def` keyword.

### Syntax

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value
```

### Example

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### The `return` Statement

- `return value`: Sends a value back to the rest of the program.
- `return`: Ends the function and goes back to the rest of the program without returning a value.

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def do_nothing():
    return
```

## Built-in Functions

Python provides several built-in functions to perform common tasks. These functions are color-coded purple in most editors.

### Examples

- `min()`: Returns the smallest value in a list.
- `max()`: Returns the largest value in a list.
- `round()`: Rounds a number to the nearest whole number or to a specified number of decimal places.
- `abs()`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
- `input()`: Reads input from the user.
- `str()`: Converts a value to a string.
- `len()`: Returns the length of a sequence.
- `tuple()`: Converts a sequence to a tuple.
- `list()`: Converts a sequence to a list.

```python
numbers = [3, 7, 1, 9]

print(min(numbers))  # Output: 1
print(max(numbers))  # Output: 9
print(round(3.14159, 2))  # Output: 3.14
print(abs(-5))  # Output: 5

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

text = "Python"
print(len(text))  # Output: 6
print(tuple(text))  # Output: ('P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n')
print(list(text))  # Output: ['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
```

## Local and Global Functions

- **Local functions**: Have limited access to the rest of the program.
- **Global functions**: Have full access to the rest of the program.

### Example

```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def local_function():
    x = 5  # Local variable
    print(x)  # Output: 5

local_function()
print(x)  # Output: 10
```

---

## Function Declaration

Functions must be declared before they are called. Otherwise, Python will raise an error.

### Example

```python
# Correct
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()

# Incorrect
say_hello()

def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

### Summary
Now that youâ€™ve mastered functions, you'll be right on your way to making complete programs! ðŸŽ‰
Up next, weâ€™ll explore **lists, tuples, and dictionaries**.
