# Conditionals and Loops

In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore conditionals and loops in Python.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand comparison and logical operators
- Learn how to use conditionals in Python
- Learn how to use loops in Python

## Comparison Operators

Before we dive into conditionals and loops, letâ€™s first understand comparison operators.
- Equal to (`==`): Compares if two values are equal
- Not equal to (`!=`): Compares if two values are not equal
- Greater than (`>`): Compares if one value is greater than the other
- Less than (`<`): Compares if one value is less than the other
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Compares if one value is greater than or equal to the other
- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Compares if one value is less than or equal to the other

---

## Logical Operators

Like comparison operators, logical operators determine the relationship between values by combining multiple conditions.
- And (`and`): Checks if all conditions are true; returns True only if every condition evaluated is true.
- Or (`or`): Checks if at least one condition is true; returns True if any one (or more) of the conditions evaluated is true.
- Not (`not`): Inverts the truth value of a condition; returns True if the condition is false, and vice versa.

## Conditionals

Conditionals are used to execute a block of code based on a condition. We can use conditionals to make decisions in our code.

### If Statements

If statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

### If-Else Statements

If-else statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

### If-Elif-Else Statements

If-elif-else statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, another block of code if another condition is true, and another block of code if all conditions are false.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```

### Nested If Statements

If statements can be nested inside other if statements.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    if x == 10:
        print("x is equal to 10")
    else:
        print("x is greater than 5 but not equal to 10")
```

### Bonus: Short Hand 

You can write conditionals on one line if it is short.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5: print("x is greater than 5")
```

```python
x = 10
print("x is greater than 5") if x > 5 else print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. We can use loops to iterate over a sequence or to execute a block of code a certain number of times.

### For Loops

For loops are used to iterate over a sequence.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

You can also use the function `range()` to loop with numerical iteration:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### While Loops

While loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

### Nested Loops

Loops can be nested inside other loops.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
adjectives = ["red", "yellow"]
for fruit in fruits:
    for adjective in adjectives:
        print(adjective, fruit)
```

### Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence.

- `break`: Terminates the loop
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration
- `pass`: Does nothing

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        break
    print(fruit)
```

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        continue
    print(fruit)
```

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    pass
```
