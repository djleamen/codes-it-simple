# Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand how to use lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Learn common operations and functions for each data type
- Practice manipulating these data structures

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items that can hold a variety of data types, including strings, booleans, floats, and integers.

### Creating a List

```python
my_list = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]
```

### Key Features
- Lists are **zero-indexed** (the first item is at index 0).
- Use `list()` to convert a value into a list.
- Combine two lists using `+` and multiply lists using `*`.

```python
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [3, 4]
combined = list1 + list2  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
repeated = list1 * 2      # [1, 2, 1, 2]
```

> Note: `x + y` is not the same as `[x] + [y]`.

### Common Functions

- `max(my_list)`: Returns the maximum value.
- `min(my_list)`: Returns the minimum value.
- `sum(my_list)`: Returns the sum of all values.
- `sorted(my_list)`: Returns a sorted copy of the list.

### Common Operations

- `.append(x)`: Adds `x` to the end of the list.
- `.remove(x)`: Removes the first occurrence of `x`.
- `.count(x)`: Counts occurrences of `x`.
- `.index(x)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of `x`.
- `.pop([i])`: Removes and returns the item at index `i` (default is the last item).
- `.reverse()`: Reverses the list in place.
- `.sort()`: Sorts the list in place.

### Example: Convert a List to a String

```python
my_list = [1, 2]
my_string = ""
for item in my_list:
    my_string += str(item)
print(my_string)  # Output: "12"
```

### Cloning and Splicing

- **Cloning**: Create an exact copy of a list.
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "orange"]
  favorite_fruits = fruits
  ```
- **Splicing**: Create a copy and modify it.
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "orange"]
  favorite_fruits = fruits[:]
  ```

### List Comprehensions

List comprehensions can help simplify your code by transforming loops and conditionals into a single, readable line. This improves performance because it usually executes faster than loops.

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Quick Aside: Fun fact!

When used in a boolean context, empty lists (`[]`) are considered to be False. More accurately, there are notions of "truthy" and "falsy" values. Empty lists are considered "falsy".

```python
if []:
    print("This won't print.")
else:
    print("Empty lists are falsy.")  # Output: Empty lists are falsy.
```

All other lists are considered True in Python.

## Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but are **immutable** (cannot be changed).

### Creating a Tuple

```python
my_tuple = (1, "hello", True)
```

### Key Features
- Use parentheses `()` to define tuples.
- Use `tuple()` to convert a value into a tuple.

### Example

```python
my_tuple = tuple(["apple", "banana"])
print(my_tuple)  # Output: ('apple', 'banana')
```

---

### Quick Aside: Slicing

Slicing can be used for strings, lists, and tuples. It's used to get a portion of your data between two indices.
Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

---

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.

### Creating a Dictionary

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "is_student": True}
```

### Key Features
- Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples).
- Values can be any data type.

### Common Operations

- Access a value: `my_dict["key"]`
- Add or update a key-value pair: `my_dict["key"] = value`
- Remove a key-value pair: `del my_dict["key"]`
- Get all keys: `my_dict.keys()`
- Get all values: `my_dict.values()`
- Get all key-value pairs: `my_dict.items()`

### Example

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
person["age"] = 26
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26}
```
