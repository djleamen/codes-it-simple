# Going Forward with SQL

Welcome to the final lecture! Youâ€™ve mastered the fundamentals of SQL, including querying, table management, and optimization. Now, letâ€™s explore advanced tools that enable you to build secure, efficient, and reusable database applications. In this session, we will explore concepts like **views**, **stored procedures**, and **transactions** to help you build robust and efficient database applications.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Define and use **views** in SQL.
- Understand and create **stored procedures**.
- Learn the concept of **transactions** and manage them with `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.

## Views in SQL

### What Is a View?
- **Definition**:
    - A view is an alternative way of representing data that exists in one or more tables or views.
    - It acts as a **named specification** of a results table that can be queried like a table.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Views are **dynamic**: They represent the data returned by the `SELECT` statement used to define them.
    - Only the **definition** of the view is stored, not the data.

### Benefits of Using Views
1. **Omit Sensitive Data**:
    - Hide columns like salaries or personal information.
2. **Combine Data**:
    - Merge columns from multiple tables or views into meaningful combinations.
3. **Simplify Access**:
    - Grant access to views for better control and security.
4. **Focus on Relevant Data**:
    - Restrict the data shown to only what is necessary for a specific use case.

### Creating a View
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT columns FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
    ```
- **Example**:
    - Create a view named `EMPINFO` to include rows where `ManagerID = 30002`:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW EMPINFO AS
    SELECT EmployeeID, Name, JobID, ManagerID
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID = 30002;
    ```

### Managing Views
1. **Querying a View**:
    - Use `SELECT` statements on the view like a table.
2. **Modifying Base Table Data**:
    - You can run `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements on the view to modify the underlying table (depending on the DBMS).
3. **Removing a View**:
    - Use `DROP VIEW` to delete the view.
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW view_name;
    ```

### Limitations
While views are powerful, some DBMSs restrict `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on views that involve joins or aggregate functions.

Best case is to use views for generating reports, hiding sensitive columns, or simplifying access for less technical users.

## Stored Procedures

### What Is a Stored Procedure?
- **Definition**:
    - A set of SQL statements stored and executed on the database server.
- **Functionality**:
    - Encapsulates multiple SQL statements into a single procedure.
    - Can accept parameters and perform **CRUD** operations.
    - Returns results to the client application.

### Benefits of Stored Procedures
1. **Reduced Network Traffic**:
    - One call executes multiple SQL statements.
2. **Improved Performance**:
    - Processing happens on the server, minimizing data transfer.
3. **Code Reusability**:
    - Multiple applications can reuse the same stored procedure.
4. **Enhanced Security**:
    - Limits table and column exposure to client-side developers.
5. **Error Handling**:
    - Can include error handling with constructs like ``TRY...CATCH``, making them reliable for critical operations.

### Creating a Stored Procedure
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameters)
    BEGIN
        SQL statements;
    END;
    ```
- **Example**:
    - Update salaries based on performance:
    ```sql
    DELIMITER $$
    CREATE PROCEDURE UPDATE_SAL (IN emp_id INT, IN rating INT)
    BEGIN
        IF rating = 1 THEN
            UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE EmployeeID = emp_id;
        ELSE
            UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.05 WHERE EmployeeID = emp_id;
        END IF;
    END$$
    DELIMITER ;
    ```

### Using a Stored Procedure
1. **Calling a Procedure**:
    ```sql
    CALL procedure_name(parameters);
    ```
    - Example:
        ```sql
        CALL UPDATE_SAL(101, 1);
        ```
2. **Integration**:
    - Call procedures from applications like Java or Python.

## Transactions and ACID Properties

### What Is a Transaction?
- **Definition**:
    - A transaction is an **indivisible unit of work** consisting of one or more SQL statements.
    - Ensures the database remains in a **consistent state**.

### ACID Properties
1. **Atomic**:
    - All changes must succeed or none at all.
2. **Consistent**:
    - The database remains consistent before and after the transaction.
3. **Isolated**:
    - No interference from other processes during the transaction.
4. **Durable**:
    - Changes from a successful transaction are permanently stored.

### Transaction Commands
1. **`BEGIN`**:
    - Starts a transaction.
2. **`COMMIT`**:
    - Saves all changes and ensures data integrity.
3. **`ROLLBACK`**:
    - Reverts all changes if an error occurs.

### Example
- **Scenario**: Process a purchase:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 200 WHERE CustomerID = 1;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 200 WHERE MerchantID = 1;
    UPDATE Inventory SET Stock = Stock - 1 WHERE ProductID = 101;
    COMMIT;
    ```
- If any statement fails, use:
    ```sql
    ROLLBACK;
    ```

### Recap
- **Views**:
    - Simplify data access and improve security.
    - Defined with `CREATE VIEW` and managed like tables.
- **Stored Procedures**:
    - Encapsulate reusable SQL logic for efficient execution.
    - Created with `CREATE PROCEDURE` and called with `CALL`.
- **Transactions**:
    - Ensure data consistency and reliability with `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
