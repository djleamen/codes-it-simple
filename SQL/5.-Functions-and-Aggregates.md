# Functions and Aggregates in SQL
Welcome to Functions and Aggregates in SQL! Now that you understand how to retrieve related data using joins, letâ€™s explore how to analyze and manipulate that data with SQL **functions and aggregates**. These tools help summarize, format, and calculate values from your queries, unlocking deeper insights from your database. 

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand and use **aggregate functions** for column operations.
- Apply **scalar functions** for individual values.
- Utilize **string functions** for text-based operations.
- Use SQL date and time functions.

### Key Concepts

#### Advantages of Built-in Functions
- Perform operations directly within the database:
    - Reduces network traffic and external processing.
    - Improves performance for large datasets.
- Built-in support for **user-defined functions** (advanced topic).

---

### Aggregate Functions
- **Purpose**: Operate on a collection of values and return a single value.

#### Examples
1. **`SUM`**: Adds all values in a column.
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(Cost) AS TotalCost FROM Orders;
    ```
2. **`MIN`**: Finds the smallest value.
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(Price) AS LowestPrice FROM Products;
    ```
3. **`MAX`**: Finds the largest value.
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(Quantity) FROM Inventory;
    ```
4. **`AVG`**: Calculates the average value.
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary FROM Employees;
    ```
5. **Mathematical Operations with Aggregates**:
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(Cost / Quantity) AS AvgCostPerUnit FROM Orders;
    ```

---

### Scalar Functions
- **Purpose**: Operate on individual values in a column.

#### Examples
1. **`ROUND`**: Rounds numeric values.
    ```sql
    SELECT ROUND(Price, 2) AS RoundedPrice FROM Products;
    ```
2. **`LENGTH`**: Returns the length of a string.
    ```sql
    SELECT LENGTH(ProductName) FROM Products;
    ```
3. **Mathematical Transformations**:
    ```sql
    SELECT ABS(Difference) FROM Metrics;
    ```

---

### String Functions
- **Purpose**: Perform operations on text data (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`).

#### Examples
1. **Convert to Uppercase**:
    ```sql
    SELECT UPPER(Name) AS UpperName FROM Customers;
    ```
2. **Convert to Lowercase**:
    ```sql
    SELECT LOWER(Name) AS LowerName FROM Customers;
    ```
3. **Combine Functions**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT(UPPER(Category)) FROM Products;
    ```

---

### Date and Time Functions

#### Supported Data Types
1. **`DATE`**: Represents a date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
2. **`TIME`**: Represents time (`HH:MM:SS`).
3. **`TIMESTAMP`**: Represents date and time (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`).

#### Extracting Components
- Extract specific components using functions:
    ```sql
    SELECT YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate) FROM Orders;
    ```

#### Date and Time Arithmetic
1. Add 7 days to a date:
    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_ADD(OrderDate, INTERVAL 7 DAY) FROM Orders;
    ```
2. Calculate the number of days since an event:
    ```sql
    SELECT DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, OrderDate) FROM Orders;
    ```

### Grouping and Aggregates

#### Eliminating Duplicates with `DISTINCT`
- **Purpose**: Removes duplicate values.
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
    ```

#### Grouping Data with `GROUP BY`
- **Purpose**: Groups rows with matching values for specified columns.
    ```sql
    SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount FROM Customers GROUP BY Country;
    ```

#### Filtering Grouped Data with `HAVING`
- **Purpose**: Filters results after grouping.
    ```sql
    SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY Country
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
    ```

---

### Subqueries and Derived Tables

#### Subqueries in `WHERE` Clause
- **Purpose**: Allow aggregate results in filtering.
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
    ```

#### Subqueries in `FROM` Clause
- **Purpose**: Use a subquery result as a virtual table.
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID) AS DeptCounts;
    ```

---

### Recap
- **Aggregate Functions**: Perform operations on entire columns.
    - Examples: `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`.
- **Scalar Functions**: Operate on individual values.
    - Examples: `ROUND`, `LENGTH`.
- **String Functions**: Manipulate text data.
    - Examples: `UPPER`, `LOWER`.
- **Date and Time Functions**: Handle dates and times for filtering and calculations.
- **Grouping**: Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to summarize data.
- **Subqueries**: Create dynamic filters or virtual tables for complex queries.
