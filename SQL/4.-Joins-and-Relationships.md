# Joins and Relationships

Welcome to Joins and Relationships in SQL! Be warned, this lesson is kind of heavy, so grab a pencil and some paper. Here, we’ll explore how to **combine data from multiple tables** using SQL joins and understand the relationships between tables through primary keys and foreign keys.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Define the **JOIN** operator.
- Understand the role of **primary keys** and **foreign keys** in JOIN operations.
- List and describe different types of JOIN operators.

### Key Concepts

#### What Is a JOIN?
- **Definition**:
    - A `JOIN` combines rows from two or more tables based on a relationship between specific columns.
- **Purpose**:
    - Retrieve data that spans multiple tables in a relational database.
- **Example**:
    - To find which borrower has a book on loan and which copy they borrowed, you combine data from the `borrower`, `loan`, and `copy` tables.

## Quick Note: Implicit Joins - The Foundation of Relationships
Before diving into explicit joins, let’s explore how tables in relational databases are related and how these relationships can be leveraged.

### Relationships in Relational Databases
- **Why Relationships Matter:**
    - Relational databases are designed to minimize redundancy by breaking data into multiple tables.
    - Relationships between tables are established using **primary keys** and **foreign key**s**.
    - Example:
        - A `borrower` table has a primary key `BorrowerID`.
        - A `loan` table uses `BorrowerID` as a foreign key to link each loan to a specific borrower.
### Implicit Joins with Simple Queries
- Sometimes, you don’t need to use explicit join operators. Instead, you can retrieve related data by querying multiple tables and using the WHERE clause to specify the relationship.
- Syntax:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table1, table2
    WHERE table1.column = table2.column;
    ```
- Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT borrower.LastName, loan.Loan_Date
    FROM borrower, loan
    WHERE borrower.BorrowerID = loan.BorrowerID;
    ```
- Explanation: Retrieves the last name of borrowers and their loan dates by matching    ``BorrowerID`` between the ``borrower`` and ``loan`` tables.
## Explicit Joins: A Better Approach
- While implicit joins work, they become harder to read and maintain in complex queries.
- Explicit joins (e.g., ``INNER JOIN``, ``LEFT JOIN``) make relationships clearer and queries more robust.
- From here on out, when we refer to JOINs, we're talking about **Explicit Joins**.

### Primary Keys and Foreign Keys in JOINs

1. **Primary Key**:
    - Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    - Example: `AuthorID`, `BookID`, `BorrowerID`, `CopyID`.

2. **Foreign Key**:
    - Refers to a primary key in *another* table.
    - Defines the relationship between tables.
    - Example: `BorrowerID` in the `loan` table refers to the `BorrowerID` primary key in the `borrower` table.

#### JOIN Example
- To know which borrower has a book on loan:
    - Match the `BorrowerID` in the `borrower` table with the `BorrowerID` in the `loan` table.
- To include the specific copy of the book:
    - Match the `CopyID` in the `loan` table with the `CopyID` in the `copy` table.

### Types of Joins

#### 1. **Inner Join**
- **Definition**:
    - Returns rows where there is a match in both tables.
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_list
    FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2
    ON table1.column = table2.column;
    ```
- **Example**:
    ```sql
    SELECT B.Borrower_ID, B.LastName, L.Loan_Date
    FROM borrower B INNER JOIN loan L
    ON B.Borrower_ID = L.Borrower_ID;
    ```
- **Use Case**:
    - Shows only borrowers who have a book on loan.

#### 2. **Outer Join**
- **Definition**:
    - Returns all matching rows, plus rows from one or both tables that don’t have a match.

##### Types of Outer Joins

1. **Left Outer Join (LEFT JOIN)**:
    - Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
    - Non-matching rows in the right table are filled with `NULL`.
    ```sql
    SELECT B.Borrower_ID, B.LastName, L.Loan_Date
    FROM borrower B LEFT JOIN loan L
    ON B.Borrower_ID = L.Borrower_ID;
    ```
    - **Use Case**: Show all borrowers, including those without loans.

2. **Right Outer Join (RIGHT JOIN)**:
    - Includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
    - Non-matching rows in the left table are filled with `NULL`.
    ```sql
    SELECT L.Loan_ID, L.Loan_Date, B.LastName
    FROM loan L RIGHT JOIN borrower B
    ON L.Borrower_ID = B.Borrower_ID;
    ```
    - **Use Case**: Show all loans, including those without borrowers.

3. **Full Outer Join (FULL JOIN)**:
    - Combines the results of **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN**.
    - Returns all rows from both tables, with `NULL` for non-matching rows.
    ```sql
    SELECT B.LastName, L.Loan_Date
    FROM borrower B FULL JOIN loan L
    ON B.Borrower_ID = L.Borrower_ID;
    ```
    - **Use Case**: Show a complete list of borrowers and loans, including unmatched rows from both sides.

### Key Details

#### Using Aliases
- Simplify queries with table aliases.
- Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT B.Borrower_ID, B.LastName, L.Loan_Date
    FROM borrower B INNER JOIN loan L
    ON B.Borrower_ID = L.Borrower_ID;
    ```

#### Result Sets
- Combine columns from both tables in the result set.
- Use `NULL` for missing values in outer joins.

### Recap
- **JOIN Operator**:
    - Combines rows from two or more tables based on a relationship.
- **Keys in JOINs**:
    - Primary keys and foreign keys establish the relationships between tables.
- **Types of Joins**:
    - **Inner Join**: Returns matching rows.
    - **Outer Join**: Includes non-matching rows depending on the type (left, right, or full).
