# Basic Queries in SQL

Welcome to Basic Queries in SQL! In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore how to **retrieve** and **filter** data from relational databases using the `SELECT` statement and various filtering techniques.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Retrieve data from a relational database table.
- Understand the use of predicates.
- Identify the syntax of the `SELECT` statement with the `WHERE` clause.
- List comparison operators supported by an RDBMS.

### Key Concepts

#### Purpose of a Database Management System
- A Database Management System (DBMS) not only stores data but also facilitates **retrieval** of data efficiently.

---

### The SELECT Statement
- **Definition**: A Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement used to query data.
- **Output**: Called a result set or result table.
- **Basic Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    ```
    - Example: `SELECT * FROM book;` retrieves all rows and columns from the `book` table.

#### Selecting Specific Columns
- Retrieve a subset of columns by specifying their names:
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
    ```
    - Example: `SELECT book_id, title FROM book;` retrieves only the `book_id` and `title` columns.
- The **order of columns** in the result matches the order in the `SELECT` statement.

---

### Filtering Data with the WHERE Clause
- **Purpose**: Restricts the result set based on a condition.
- **Predicate**: A condition that evaluates to true, false, or unknown, used in the `WHERE` clause.
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    ```
    - Example: `SELECT title FROM book WHERE book_id = 'B1';` retrieves the title of the book where `book_id` equals `B1`.

#### Comparison Operators
- `=` (equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `!=` or `<>` (not equal to)
- `BETWEEN` - commonly used for filtering ranges
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM COUNTRY WHERE ID BETWEEN 2 AND 5;
    ```
---

### Examples of SELECT Queries
Below is an example database table called `COUNTRY`:

| **ID** | **Name**                  | **CCode** |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 1      | United States of America | US        |
| 2      | China                    | CH        |
| 3      | Japan                    | JA        |
| 4      | Germany                  | GE        |
| 5      | India                    | IN        |
| 6      | United Kingdom           | UK        |
| 7      | France                   | FR        |
| 8      | Italy                    | IT        |
| 9      | Canada                   | CA        |
| 10     | Brazil                   | BR        |

#### Example 1: Retrieve All Rows and Columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM COUNTRY;
```
**Response**:
Retrieves all rows and columns from the `COUNTRY` table.

#### Example 2: Retrieve Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT ID, Name FROM COUNTRY;
```
**Response**:
Returns the `ID` and `Name` columns only.

#### Example 3: Filtering Data with a Condition
```sql
SELECT * FROM COUNTRY WHERE ID <= 5;
```
**Response**:
Retrieves rows where the `ID` is less than or equal to 5.

#### Example 4: Filtering with a Specific Value
```sql
SELECT * FROM COUNTRY WHERE CCode = 'CA';
```
**Response**:
Returns the row where the `CCode` is `CA` (Canada).

### Additional Expressions

#### 1. **COUNT**
- **Purpose**: Retrieves the number of rows that match the query criteria.
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
    ```
- **Example**:
    - Count total rows:
        ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM COUNTRY;
        ```
        Returns the total number of rows in the COUNTRY table.
    - Count rows where `CCode` is 'US':
        ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM COUNTRY WHERE CCode = 'US';
        ```

#### 2. **DISTINCT**
- **Purpose**: Removes duplicate values from the result set.
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
    ```
- **Example**:
    - Retrieve unique country codes:
        ```sql
        SELECT DISTINCT CCode FROM COUNTRY;
        ```
- **Example**:
    - Return the count of unique CCode values:
        ```sql
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CCode) FROM COUNTRY;
        ```

#### 3. **LIMIT***
- **Purpose**: Restricts the number of rows retrieved from the database.
- **Syntax**:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT n;
    ```
- **Example**:
    - Retrieve the first 3 rows:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM COUNTRY LIMIT 3;
        ```

*note: LIMIT is specific to certain SQL dialects like MySQL, PostgreSQL and may require alternatives (FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY) in databases like Oracle or SQL Server.

### Recap
- Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from a database.
- Filter results using predicates in the `WHERE` clause.
- Apply additional expressions like `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, and `LIMIT` to enhance query functionality.
